# GNSSGO GUI Refactoring Project

## Project Context

We are refactoring the `gui/frontend` directory to use the latest Angular framework instead of the current vanilla JavaScript implementation. This is part of a larger effort to modernize the GNSSGO application and improve its maintainability and extensibility.

The GNSSGO application is a GNSS RTK library that provides functionality for working with GNSS data. The GUI frontend provides a user interface for interacting with this library.

## Current Status

- Created a new Angular project in the `gui/frontend` directory
- Updated the wails.json configuration to use Angular CLI
- Copied the Wails bindings from the original frontend
- Copied the assets from the original frontend
- Updated the angular.json file to include the assets
- Migrated the CSS styles from the original frontend

## TODO List

### High Priority

1. **Update the app.component.html and app.component.ts files** ✅
   - Replace the Angular default template with our custom UI ✅
   - Implement the same functionality as the original main.js ✅
   - Connect to the Wails Go bindings ✅

2. **Configure the index.html file** ✅
   - Update to properly load the Angular application ✅
   - Ensure it works with Wails ✅

3. **Test the Wails build**
   - Ensure the Wails build works with the new Angular frontend
   - Fix any issues that arise during the build process

### Medium Priority

4. **Implement proper Angular architecture** ✅
   - Create separate components for different parts of the UI ✅
   - Implement proper services for API calls ✅
   - Use Angular's dependency injection for better maintainability ✅

5. **Improve the UI/UX**
   - Enhance the user interface using Angular Material or another UI library
   - Implement responsive design for better usability on different devices

### Low Priority

6. **Add unit tests**
   - Implement unit tests for Angular components
   - Ensure good test coverage for critical functionality

7. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new Angular frontend
   - Add comments to the code for better maintainability

## Implementation Notes

- The original frontend was using a simple vanilla JavaScript setup with Vite as the build tool
- The new frontend uses Angular 19 with its CLI tools
- We need to ensure that all the original functionality is preserved while taking advantage of Angular's features
- The Wails bindings need to be properly integrated with Angular's dependency injection system
